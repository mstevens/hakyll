# Simple examples

A number of simple examples are available in the GitHub repository. They can be
found [here](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll-examples). The README located
in that directory explains which example does what. You can fetch the entire
directory using

    git clone git://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll-examples.git

# People using Hakyll

A lot of sites running Hakyll also publish the source code. This is a very
interesting resource to learn from as well. If you're using Hakyll for your
site, and the source code is available, please notify me so I can add you to
this list. This list has no particular ordering.
